# README.md Generator

To see working: https://readme-generator-test-1.onrender.com

This following readme was made by the README.md Generator

This Flask-based web application simplifies the creation of professional, Markdown-formatted README.md files for software projects.  Leveraging the Gemini API (specific API version would be stated here if known), it generates README files based on user-provided project details. Users input project information via a user-friendly HTML/CSS form, and the application instantly produces a downloadable README.md file.  API keys are securely managed using a `.env` file.


## Features

* **Automated README Generation:** Quickly create well-structured README.md files without manual formatting.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  A clean and intuitive HTML/CSS form simplifies data entry.
* **Gemini API Integration:** Leverages the power of the Gemini API for high-quality Markdown generation.
* **Secure API Key Handling:** Employs a `.env` file for secure storage of API keys, preventing exposure in the codebase.
* **Instant Download:** Generated README files are instantly available for download.
